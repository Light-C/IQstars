<What are the best features of this code?


Is the code well-documented?


Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?


Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?


If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.
