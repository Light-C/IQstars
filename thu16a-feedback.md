## LATE SUBMISSION (SEE GIT LOG)
## Tutor Comment
Overall very nice work! I really liked the way you have tried to implement your code in a
clear and concise manner. Here are some suggestions: -
1. There is still opportunity for improvement in terms of overall code quality. I realised there are some unresolved
   warnings in the code. It's always nice to get rid of these trivial warnings before submitting the final version of the code.
2. The code has clear authorship details and is well-commented, which I always like :).
3. Try using concise `if` statements - instead of `if(isGameStringWellFormed(wizardStr) == true)`, you can just use
   `if(isGameStringWellFormed(wizardStr))`.
4. Nice work on the overall UI design, might need to build a help menu (somewhere besides the board) 
   to aid the user about `/` and other functionalities in the game.

Overall a solid attempt has been made for this assignment :) Keep up the enthusiasm!
